# Pointers
A. Access Array using Pointers.                                                                                                                                                                                        
The program demonstrates the use of pointers to access and iterate through arrays of integers and floating-point numbers.                                                                                                
Algorithm:

For Integer Array:
1. Create an integer array 'arr' with 5 elements.
2. Create an integer pointer 'arrptr' and initialize it to point to the first element of 'arr' (i.e., &arr[0]).
3. Use a 'for' loop to iterate over the 'arr' array:
   a. Inside the loop:
      i. Print the value pointed to by 'arrptr' using '*arrptr'.
      ii. Print the memory address stored in 'arrptr' using 'arrptr'.
      iii. Increment 'arrptr' to point to the next integer element in the array.

For Floating-Point Array:
4. Display "Float Array".
5. Create a double array 'farr' with 5 elements.
6. Create a double pointer 'farrptr' and initialize it to point to the first element of 'farr' (i.e., &farr[0]).
7. Use a 'for' loop to iterate over the 'farr' array:
   a. Inside the loop:
      i. Print the value pointed to by 'farrptr' using '*farrptr'.
      ii. Print the memory address stored in 'farrptr' using 'farrptr'.
      iii. Increment 'farrptr' to point to the next double element in the array.

End of the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
B. Basics of Pointers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The program demonstrates the use of pointers to store and retrieve values for both integer and floating-point variables.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Algorithm:

1. Create integer variables 'var' and 'b', and a floating-point variable 'fvar'.
2. Create an integer pointer 'ptr' and a floating-point pointer 'floatptr'.
3. Initialize 'ptr' to point to the address of 'var' and 'floatptr' to point to the address of 'fvar'.
4. Display "Enter a number=" and read an integer value into 'var'.
5. Print the value of 'var' using 'var'.
6. Print the value stored in the 'ptr' pointer using '*ptr'.
7. Print the memory location (address) of 'var' using 'ptr'.
8. Print the memory location (address) of the 'ptr' pointer using '&ptr'.

9. Display "Enter a float number=" and read a floating-point value into 'fvar'.
10. Print the value of 'fvar' using 'fvar'.
11. Print the value stored in the 'floatptr' pointer using '*floatptr'.
12. Print the memory location (address) of 'fvar' using 'floatptr'.
13. Print the memory location (address) of the 'floatptr' pointer using '&floatptr'.
